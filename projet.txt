## *S*ituation
When I was starting as a research assistant last year, 

## *T*ask
I was tasked with developing a method for captioning images of pedestrians.

## *A*ction
I quickly found that there were no methods currently for assigning precise colors. So I remembered a comic I read from Randal Munroe, in which he asked his readers to label patches of colors.
He had made the results of the survey available, and it turns out it was by far bigger than any datasets on colors.
Then I I trained a decision tree on this data.

## *R*esult
I achieved state of the art results on this task, using a model that is much less computationaly intensive than other methods.


# Papier2
## Situation
Still working on my master

## Task
My task was to develop a method for captioning images of pedestrian. This often requires complex machine learning models that require lots of data.

## Action
I remember reading about explanation methods, that allow us to kind of "debug" neural networks by highlighting which parts of the input (image) played the bigger role in making a prediction.
So I though we could use this information for sampling masks.

## Result
I developed a method competitive with state of the art.

# Robot
## Situtation
In my first year as a grad student, I enrolled in a computer vision and robotics course.

## Task
We had to work on a project in which we programmed a robot assistant. It had a lidar at ground level and we wanted to use this lidar to detect groups of persons.

## Action
We used clustering methods to detect the feet and then pairs of feet.

## Results
It worked, although it wasn't robust to groups of people. Which doesn't matter, as long as it detected them.

 
# Compilateur
## Situation
Software Engineering project.

## Task
We had to write a compiler for the MinCaml language.

## Action
We worked.

## Result 
I worked well, including optimisations

## TODO
Revoir:
- l'architecture du compilateur
- mes tâches
- les tâches de chacun
- le mincaml / l'ocaml

# Github
## Situation
There is an institute in the UK called Forensic Architecture. They are non-profit and aim to use open access data to highlight and give proof of human rights abuses. I discovered this agency while I was following the Syrian civil war, and they had released a study on a gas attack on Douma in 2018, during on of the last pushes of the Russian army.

## Task
I saw that they have a public discord as well as a github repository, so I asked how I can help.
They told me they are looking to add new analyses to their tool.

## Action
Using my experience in computer vision, I adapted models developed by other researchers to FA's framework.

## Results
Now we can detect protests, violence and fires.
