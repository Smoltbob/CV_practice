## Tell me about a time you used customer feedback to change the way you worked
### Ex 1
When I was working at my first internship.

At the end of the internship, he summoned me for a debrief. He told me he was overall quite satisfied with my performance, and in fact I had cleared the original internship task faster than he had anticipated. However he told me I was just too shy and too passive, and that for my future contracts I should make sure to be more proactive, and that was eye-opening for me. I always followed this advice and became a more dynamic coworker.


### Ex 2
A few months ago I had to give a presentation about my work to a public that had no technical knowledge.

I wanted my communication to be as understandable as possible, so I made sure to give it in a simple high-level form.

They still told me it wasn't understandalble, so I improved.

## Tell me about a time you had to compromise to satisfy a customer
Creaform: wanted to try ML but we stayed with traditional CV bc of speed, reliability and préjugés. 

## How do you get to an understanding of what a customer's needs are ?
I ask for feedback, use previous works, imagine.
- logging system

### Ex 1
At my work place there are about 70% percent phd students and 30% grad students. Virtually all of them have academic backgrounds and not engineering like I do, so I often saw them struggling to do "basic" tasks.

I often help them with command line applications, ssh, etc and I'm gradually writing a wiki page for our team where newcomers can find common useful information.

As a result everyone is working more efficiently. That proved very useful during the quarantine as we have to work from home, accessing our computers through SSH.


## Time when you helped someone in their work.
I often help my coworkers in their work. For instance, if they need some of my expertise. Ex: Alexandre asks me for my color model.
+ talk about wiki

## Time when you helped someone grow in career and it benefited them.
During my first year of studying at university the son of my landlords was working on his business buying and reselling high end minerals to museums and collectors.

I practice photography for ten years now, so he asked me for help taking pictures of his minerals. At first, I took the product shots myself for him.
Then I taught him photography 101.

As a result, he had a nice website and since then he's kept himself up to date. Now he's looking at photogrametry and 3D scanning.

# Are Right, A Lot
Show you trust your instincts

## Time when you pushed back a decision from your management for better long term benefits.
None
When chosing the language for the project, I chose OCaml instead of Java or C.
    
## Time when your team members were not supporting something but you pushed and went for a more optimal solution.

### Ex 1
Maybe choosing OpenCV, however I don't know about the long term benefits (secrecy).

### Ex 2
Choosing OCaml

## Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with someone on your team. What was it about? What did you do? How did they react? What was the outcome?
### Example 1
During my first year of grad studies, I was working on a software engineering project.
We had to develop a compiler.

One of my responsabilities was to manage our team, in addition to working on the project the project of course.
One of my team mates was often quite confrontational. He was also very clever, especially good in math but he didn't know how to colaborate and communicate. I think maybe he wanted to be leader in my place.

It wasn't pleasant but I ended up making compromises for him because I wanted him to be on the team with us and not cut him. 

It worked well, we gave a good final product.

### Example 2
During the compiler project, I wanted to have team meetings.
I'm a morning person, but so I set the meetings every morning at 8h30.
Most people came, however litteraly after two days it became clear this was too eatly for most people, and alread some of them didn't really want to participate in the first place.
So I proposed that we shifted the meetings at 11h, but that everyone made sure to come. They were happy with this situation, and even though I knew a friend of mine would have rather stayed home, he made sure to come.

## Tell me about a time when your teammate didn't agree with you? What did you do?

## Time when you did not have enough data and had to use judgement to make decision. Give two or three examples
- When chosing schools
- Hackathon

## Tell me about a time you had multiple solutions and you had to select an optimal one
### Ex 1
Building an object classifier for FA
They were looking for detecting protests and fires.

Choices: 
- crowd counting
- ML model
- segmentation for fires

I chose to combine the two models into one, as it is more optimal for the agency : 

- easier to maintain
- performs all detections in one pass

### Ex 2
Choosing between languages for compiler project.

Choices:
- C
- Java
- OCaml

## Tell me about a time when you had to decide upon something without consulting your superior.
When I work, I often try my ideas before asking him, and if it workds well, then I ask him if it would make sense to move forward.
I don't want to waste his time asking if I can implement ideas that turn out to be pointless.


## Have you ever been in a situation where you had to make a choice among a few options, but did not have a lot of time to explore each option
I was participatign with to a hackathon.

We had to write an AI, and because we didn't have time to think too much, we just went with the most intuitive solution. So we chose the solution that would allow guarantee us to get results.

We ended up sticking with it and just improving it.

It gave great results.


## Tell me about a time where you had to make a decision based on limited information and how it impacted the outcome.
I refered to the experience of my peers.

## Tell me about a time where you did not know something and how you tackled it
## Ex 1 
Making a live demo

## Ex 2
Making an ML model for XKCD.

I very often don't know something. I like having ideas and then trying to figure out how I'd do it (rather than starting from what I know).
So I chose my idea I want to work on and then I try to figure out how to do it.
For instance: idea about using XKCD.
When I'm stuck, I ask my peers for pointers on how they'd deal with it, until I have a pool of my own and their ideas. Then I start learning.

## Time when you failed to meet your commitment, committed a mistake
### First mistake
During my internship at Pfeiffer Vacuum I was working on a system for generating automatically logs about production machines and serve it as HTML tables embeded to emails.

To do so, I was pooling from a service that was agregating sensor data from the production line. However, I forgot to clean up, so intermediate data accumulated into the server and hogged all of its resources. What I didn't know is that it was a critical server for running operations as well because there was basically only one server.

When I arrived the following day, there was talks about machines having stopped,etc and my supervisor quickly realised it was from me. It cost a few hours of downtime in the early morning. He took responsability for this and kindly told me that I should test more next time.

Now I'm absolutely taking care of doing dry runs in a controlled environment to be confident that there will be no side effects, and I stay aware that there can be side effects, so I should be able to identify them faster.

### Second mistake
During my work in the lab, I was working on  a method that requires to visualize a neural network's decision. I used a method I found on github, that was published alongside a paper.

This method gave me good results when I tried it, which is that you could clearly see in images the places the network was looking at. So I used it.

Then by doing further reading (name paper) a few weeks later, I realized that this method (name method) was actually basically useless, but that due to my confirmation bias, I just assumed it did. I felt stupid, and thankfully I could find an alternative that gave me a similar performance.

I could have lost weeks of work, or maybe even have to rethink my whole approach if I hadn't found an alternative. So now I'd like to have as much data or even better, formal proofs that a method does what it says, especially when it's shiny and new.

### Ex 1
During my very first internship, I was 19 at this time, and it was an internship centered on doing a case study for supervision tools. These tools were supposed to gather metrics about the factory. 

When looking at how this data would be used, I realized technicians were just browsing a document. Instead, I thought I could save them a few minutes every day by sending this data in a nice HTML table in their email inbox.

So I learned how to use Powershell (I didn't know about scripting back then and I really loved object oriented shell scripting), as they worked with windows, and wrote some proof of concepts.

My supervisor really liked and asked me to survey the team to see what they think of it. They gave me some feedback on the kind of data they require, then I implemented it and we set up my scripts to be ran every morning.

I wanted to develop a method that would focus in images.
Talk about loss function in paper 2.

FIND CLEARER EXAMPLE

## Received negative feedback from manager and how you responded.
My managers never gave me a lot of negative feedback. During my first internship, at the end, my manager gave me advice, which I appreciated and followed. 

However nowadays when I submit my papers to peer-reviewed conferences, I recieve feedback from the reviewing commitee.
The feedback is often negative, as reviewers tend to focus more on points of improvement.
I follow the advice quite closely.
When someone gives critisms, it means they spend time looking at your work and that they believe in can be made better.


## Tell me about a time when your earned your teammate's trust?
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE
I earn their trust during daily interactions by being honest with myself and with them.

This allowed me to see where everyone was going, and also to adjust goals according to their feedback.
We also assigned roles according to skills.

## Tell me about a time when you excedeed your goals.
When I had to write a report but I wrote a jupyer demo / web demo.

## Have you ever worked really hard and failed ?
Failure to make video work on the drone
In my undergrad, I had a software engineering project where I had to write and Android app to communicate and control a drone by sending it *TCP* packets.
The drone had a decent communication so it went well, until I decided I'd like to stream the video from its cameras.

I never managed to get a decent stream. I felt like I tried everything, analysing the the flow using wireshark, trying different payloads, different image processing libraries, I also tried to look for open source projects doing similar things, with no success.

Trying all this, I learned a lot about networking abd debuging.

## Most complex problem you've ever worked on ?
The compiler project.


## Tell me about a time you faced an obstacle and how you overcame it.
Learning english and joining an international master

Failure at graph theory exam -> retook a smilar class the year after

### Ex 3
I was working on building a speedometer for a model train using an old PS/2 mouse.

This was done using an FPGA and the VHDL programming language to essentially write a hardware interface for the mouse and expose it as a linux driver.

I had tons of difficulties communicating with the mouse (using a state machine) and stayed super late with my prof.

In the end, I managed to have the speedometer working.


### Ex 4
This winter I had to give a presentation at at SERI.

I used to be anxious when talking in public, so that was a challenge.

I followed a course in oral communication and learned some interesting techniques.

Now I definetely feel more comfortable.

## Tell me about a time when you needed help from someone during a project.
Working on the math project


## A time when you faced a setback initially but still achieved the goal.
Working at creaform : all the pb with libraries etc

## A Tell me about a time when you felt under pressure that you wouldn't be able to get something done or had to take a pivot at the last minute

When I was working on a battleship game. Ditched AI for human player.

## Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your deadline?
The most extreme one was during my undergrad. I was working on a math project on heat transfer with a friend.

We had to leave the school at 10pm and ran accross campus to my dorm, where we decided to stop the project and run some late tests until the last minute!

Now I can see deadlines approach from farther away.
I was working with the intent to submit my work at the ICPR conference.
About two weeks before the deadline, I decided it wasn't useful to push for better results, even though, that would have been great, and instead I made sure my current results were robust and spent more time writing the paper.

 I knew I wanted to improve my metrics. However it became clear that I wouldn’t have the time to do so. Therefore I developed a method for catching failure cases and improve the robustness of my work, even though its performance hasn’t changed, but it was a way of telling my readers and reviewers that I’m aware of my work’s shortcomings.

When I can, always try to aim for an early dummy deadline. It’s naive but it removes that feeling of comfort you get from long deadlines.

+ time when you had to cut corners
+ how do you handle tight deadlines
